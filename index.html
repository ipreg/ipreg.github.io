<p>Have you ever thought “it would be really great to have the entire standard python library or other libraries like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=renpy+numpy+site%3Alemmasoft.renai.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numpy</a> inside Ren’Py, but the packages pip installs aren’t working or keep returning errors?”. Well, you are probably going to need to recompile Ren’Py of which the information about is no where and how to change the build files are similar. I also discuss using PyPy as a supplement to Ren’Py to help move things along at the bottom of the post.</p>

<p>A key goal of mine when I went into “A Town Unfiltered” was to make it as dynamic as possible. The original game was running into technical debt where every change had to be accounted for in long sections of if-else statements. This lead to a large list of “story” variables which kept track of the game state and different situations had to ensure what combination of story variables were what values to lead the player into the correct conversation. This is really bad game design on the development side, while it initially allows for quick prototyping and iteration due to the simplicity of the code, for anything more complex than a game jam game it will become a ball and chain where it slows development and to fix becomes making a whole new game. This is what I suspect occurred with “yandere simulator” and it could happen to “A Town Uncovered”, I think that the story events are disparate enough that this sort of design kind of works because they are essentially making a bunch of small games inside a big one, which might prevent them from falling into a similar trap (Having the resources to pay for programmers to spend the time to trudge through it helps too).</p>

        </h3>
<p>I decided to spend some time learning how to perform shaders inside Ren’Py. Specifically I wanted to be able to port shaders from <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShaderToy</a> into Ren’Py. While there <a href="https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/model.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a page on it</a> in the documentation, it doesn’t really give very good examples on how to implement them yourself or that Ren’Py literally implements the entirety of GLSL (As long as your system supports it). These shaders can be placed on literally any image in the game and I actually got much better framerates inside Ren’Py then I did inside the Shadertoy website itself.</p>

<p>This is an old post I made when I was (at the time) playing around a lot with dynamic scenes with lots of custom <a href="https://www.renpy.org/dev-doc/html/cdd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">displayable</a> objects; while that code was not used for version -0.1 of the mod, the rabbit hole I went down taught me a lot about how renpy actually takes images and puts them on screen; and also how to manipulate them. If you really wanted to, you can build any kind of game inside Ren’Py; it probably wouldn’t run very well, but the amount of flexibility is amazing. I have slightly edited the post, if you want to see the original click <a href="https://f95zone.to/threads/a-town-unfiltered-a-town-uncovered-mod-wolfregis.34101/page-17#post-6059223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome to the blog! I am semi-active on the <a href="https://f95zone.to/members/ipreg.2927439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F95 Zone</a> and the programmer for the mod <a href="https://f95zone.to/threads/a-town-unfiltered-a-town-uncovered-mod-wolfregis.34101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Town Unfiltered</a>. Working on A Town Unfiltered has really filled my head with thoughts that I want to get out into the world and F95 doesn’t really have a good way to do this (it is a forum first and foremost after all); so I’ll post it here, where it will stay until github’s servers implode or something.</p>
